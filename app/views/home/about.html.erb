My name is Ibrahim and I'm gonna introduce you to the future coins. Welcome to my FurtureCoin website. One of the things made me decide to build this website is the {37% Rule}.<br> The 37% rule says that if you have a decision to make, you should spend 37% of the amount of time you have. This is called exploration period. Seek advice, learn about demands of the role, and meet some candidates.
After you’ve explored, you transition to exploit. Exploit in this context doesn’t mean to take advantage of or misuse, but to seize the opportunity and capitalize on your knowledge.

<h1 style= "font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><strong>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h1>
<p> You might be wondering, “What gives a cryptocurrency unit its value?”

For most assets, the value is determined by market factors. Let’s take the real estate market, for example. What determines the value of a property? A property might be appraised higher if it’s in a desirable location, or if it’s more luxurious, or if it’s in a neighborhood that’s likely to see an increase in home prices.

What about stocks? Stock value is generally determined by the success of the company (or the impending success of the company). Higher profits mean higher dividends, which means higher stock prices.

Cryptocurrency values are also tied to the marketplace, but in a different way. There’s no physical asset that’s affected by the local economy. And the value isn’t tied to corporate profits. The value of a cryptocurrency unit is entirely dependent on whether or not people want to buy cryptocurrency units.

Wait… what??

You read that correctly. The value of cryptocurrency is based on nothing but consumer interest in buying cryptocurrency. If lots of people are buying crypto, then the value will rise. If people stop buying crypto, then the value will fall.

This is a head-scratching concept for both beginning and veteran investors. But it’s not such a crazy idea to high-risk investors who frequently trade in volatile assets. A “volatile asset” is an asset that may experience large and rapid changes in value. Penny stocks are a common (and more “socially acceptable”) type of volatile asset. They often pose too much risk for the average investor, but they can yield extremely high returns to those wolves of Wall Street who carefully study marketplace activity.

In the same vein, cryptocurrency can yield high returns if an investor takes advantage of marketplace surges.</p>

<h1 style= "font-family: 'Courier New', monospace"><strong>What Do You Need To Invest In Cryptocurrency?</h1>
<p>While the idea of cryptocurrency can be daunting to beginner investors, the requirements to get started are minimal. If you want to learn how to invest in cryptocurrency, you only need:

Personal identification documents

Bank account information

Secure internet connection

That’s it! It is possible to purchase cryptocurrency through a stockbroker as well. In this case, most of your personal and financial information will be on file already. Now that you have what you need, let’s start investing.

Tips to Know Before Investing in Cryptocurrency
Here are a couple of important things you should know before investing in cryptocurrency.

Capital Gains Tax: For tax purposes, cryptocurrency is considered an asset, like a stock or property. When you sell crypto and make a profit, you’ll have to pay capital gains tax on what you earned. Keep this in mind when you’re budgeting for the year and planning for taxes.

Short-Term Investing: Because cryptocurrency is a volatile asset, many investors would consider it to be a short-term investment rather than a long-term one. It’s possible that in the future, cryptocurrency may become a stable investment and that long-term holdings will yield significant profit. But that’s a big “if.”

Since cryptocurrency values have been decreasing, you might have a better chance of making a profit by timing the market. That’s incredibly risky, but crypto is high-risk. If you want your money to appreciate over a long period, you’re better off investing in long-term bonds, index funds, or IRAs.</p>
